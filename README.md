# Arduino-Robot

This project will consist of
1. Arduino line follower
2. Arduino bluetooth RC car

I will also provide test codes

1. Arduino line follower

Arduino based line follower robot

This is my first arduino based line follower. I'm using this to learn how the motor works, the IR works and overall system works. I've made several tests to allow step by step understanding on how this works. By breaking down into small pieces, I hope this can be understood by someone who is really new to Arduino.

I'm trying to avoid using library in the code to make it as simple as possible. And the fact that I don't understand them as well.

Parts list:

Arduino UNO R3
L298N motor driver
5 in 1 infra red sensors
2 ea DC motors
Battery pack and switch
Robotic base kits to attach the motors and the parts
Steps:

Assemble the parts Assemble the robotics base kit & motors. Connect the battery pack to L298N motor driver. Refer to below illustration.
