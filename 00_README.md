# Arduino-Robot

Learning steps
1. Assemble robot
2. Understanding motor driver & motor
3. Understanding IR Sensor
4. Making a line follower robot
5. Understanding bluetooth
6. Making a remote controlled robot


This is my first arduino based robot. I'm using this to learn how the motor works, the IR works and overall system works. I've made several tests to allow step by step understanding on how this works. By breaking down into small pieces, I hope this can be understood by someone who is really new to Arduino.

I'm trying to avoid using library in the code to make it as simple as possible. And the fact that I don't understand them as well.

Parts list:
- Robotic base kits to attach the motors and the parts
- Arduino UNO R3
- L298N motor driver
- 5 in 1 infra red sensors
- 2 ea DC motors
- Battery pack and switch
- HC-06 bluetooth module

Steps:

Assemble the parts Assemble the robotics base kit & motors. Connect the battery pack to L298N motor driver. Refer to below illustration.
